A simple tool for creating stop motion animation sequences using a webcam.

Animation sequences can be saved to a video file in the widely-supported webm format.  Previously-saved videos can be loaded into the app and extended. When complete, an audio track may be recorded (audio support is a bit buggy at the moment, YMMV).

This is a free, open-source, non-commercial app.  It does not collect any information, and once installed, it operates completely offline.

The source code lives here (patches welcome):
